LuaG library - C API specification

Each major version of the api has one file, a shared library, and its filename
is formatted as follows:

"luag-lib-v$V.$v.$ext"

where:
- $V is the major version number
- $v is the minor version number
- $ext is the OS-specific extension. (in GNU/Linux the extension is .so)


A minor version does not break compatibility with older versions of the same
API major version, but a LuaG game that uses a newer minor version cannot be
run using an older minor version.


In the library, there must be two functions:

int luag_lib_load(lua_State *L);
int luag_lib_destroy(void);

The return value must be 0 on success and nonzero on error.


In `luag_lib_load` the api functions and/or variables must be added
into the lua_State.


The shared librares can be compiled against the core LuaG application headers.
